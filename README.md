# Welcome to Mimmage!

## What is Mimmage?

Mimmage is a web application with the goal to help people memorize passages of text.  The strength of Mimmage over other methods of memorization is that mimmage can be used **hands free**.  Even if the only time a person has to memorize is during their morning commute to work, Mimmage is there to help.

## How it Works

The user takes a block of text and breaks it up into small, easily repeatable segments.  Mimmage will then read the segments for the user on loop for as many times as needed (default is 24 times is optimal for a lot of people).  The idea is that the person memorizes by the same method they would use to learn a new language.  Again, once the application is set

## How to Run a Local Dev Server

1. Clone the repository locally.  
2. Make sure `npm` is installed and install dependencies with:
`npm install`
3. Run the dev server with:
`npm start`

The dev server should start on `localhost:3000` by default!
